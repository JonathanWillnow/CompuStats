# CompuStats

Final project for the course Computational Statistics at the University of Bonn, summerterm 2021.

## Overview
For this project,


The project should include
1. a description of the method,
2. a simulation study using a realistic set-up from a research paper in economics
as a motivation and benchmarking,
3. and (ideally) an empirical application.
The description should also include theoretical properties of the method together
with the properties of the data most often encountered in empirical settings. The
simulation study should reflect these two components. You may collaborate (i.e.
discuss) with other students who are working within the same general method, for
example, lasso, but everyone has to hand in an individual project.

## Reproducibility


![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-template-course-project/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

For full reproducibility of this project, an continuous integration workflow was set up using [GitHub Actions CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). I also provided an environment.yml file of my environment to ensure full reproducibility of my notebook.
