# Computational Statistics, Summer 2021 by Marina Khismatullina | Jonathan Willnow | Partitioning and Hierarchical Clustering and their validation

This is the final project for the course Computational Statistics at the University of Bonn (summerterm 2021) b< Jonathan Willnow



## Project overview

This notebook explores Partitioning and Hierarchical clustering algorithms and their validation. It contains a simulation study as well as a empirical application for K-Means clustering.

## Reproducibility


![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-template-course-project/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

For full reproducibility of this project, a continuous integration workflow was set up using [GitHub Actions CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). I also provided an environment.yml file of my environment to ensure full reproducibility of my notebook.


## Acknowledgement

I would also like to thank all the awesome people that provide their knowledge by creating and managing the various documentations and coding examples available all over the internet. Special thanks to Dr. Marina Khismatullina and Prof. Dr. Philipp Eisenhauer, who have taught me a lot in the last two semesters and without whom I would not have been able to complete this project.
